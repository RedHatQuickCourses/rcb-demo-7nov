#  Ansible Basics

Ansible is an open-source automation engine used for configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. It simplifies IT orchestration by enabling users to manage multiple machines from a central control node. Ansible is agentless, meaning it doesn't require any special software installed on the managed hosts, relying instead on standard SSH for Linux/Unix hosts and WinRM for Windows. Its architecture comprises a Control Node, which executes automation, and Managed Hosts, the target servers. Key components include inventory files to define hosts, modules for executing specific tasks, and playbooks that define automation workflows in YAML. Plugins extend Ansible's core functionality, enhancing various aspects of automation. This declarative approach makes automation scripts easy to read and write.
